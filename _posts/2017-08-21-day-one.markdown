Today is my first day as a resident apprentice at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/), and the first time I've ever blogged! Bear with me as I deal with the growing pains that come with trying new things. I'll be dumping my brain into these posts, and things might get a bit weird, but hopefully both you (the reader) and I will learn something along the way!

My mentor and I both decided that it would be best for me to start learning a second programming language ASAP, and settled on Python as the most promising option. I'm currently working through the 'Python Koans' as a way to quickly learn by doing.

Everything seemed like it was going to be a cake walk until I was informed I'd be using Vim to complete my challenges...

My previeous experience with Vim had come from accidentally entering the program, and then stuggling to figure out how to exit
before rage quitting my terminal.

Vim requires an entire blog post on its own (which will come shortly).

GOOD NIGHT!
