This is a quick post of sites that will distract you and decrease your productivity. __BEWARE__.

* [Reddit](http://www.Reddit.com)
* [Wait But Why](http://www.Waitbutwhy.com)
* [Giphy](http://www.Giphy.com)
* [Commits Logs From Last Night](http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/)
* [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com)
* [Code Pen](http://www.codepen.io)

I'm making this list as a thought experiment, to see if I can identify parts of my digital identity that eat up chunks of my time, and don't provide any real value.

Some things on the list can be used for infomation gathering (reddit), but can have the tendancy to provide a gateway for distraction.

I'll continue to update the list as I get distracted.
