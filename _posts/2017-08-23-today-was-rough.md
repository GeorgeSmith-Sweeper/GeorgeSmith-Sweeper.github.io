Today was a very humbling day for me. Vim is proving to be more of a challenge than I thought.
I'm expending loads of mental energy trying to move around, and edit text, which leaves very little bandwidth left to actually solve Katas and refactor after testing.

I've always used IDE's like Sublime Text, and have been comfortable using the built in features and mouse based GUI to speed up my workflow, but Vim punishes you for even thinking about using a mouse

All is not lost.

I'm currently reading [Seven habits of effective text editing](http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html) as recommended by my mentor, along with his blog post [Optimizing your workflow with Vim](https://8thlight.com/blog/jerome-goodrich/2017/01/17/Vim-and-TDD.html).
Between the two of these posts and some 6:30am `vimtutor`, I'm looking to lift my spirts, and wield the power that Vim holds!
