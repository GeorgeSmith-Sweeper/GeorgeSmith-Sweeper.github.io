Last night, after a long day of setting up tests and refactoring lines of python, I thought it would be a great idea to jazz up my dev environment with a bit of color, and some syntax highlighting. 

I promptly dove into the docs of [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) in order to quickly get up and running with the latest and greatest plugins. Once I felt like a understood how plugins worked, I selected [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for IDE like autocompletions, [Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) to create usefull snippets, and [vim-colors-solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) to better differentiate pieces of code.
