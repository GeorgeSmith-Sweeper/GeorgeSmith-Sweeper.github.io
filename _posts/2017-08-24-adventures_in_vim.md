I may have just found the most engaging way to learn Vim that has ever been created!

### Vim Adventures
Vim adventures is a Zelda like game that forces you to use Vims keyboard controls/commands in order to navigate your player and solve puzzles. 
So far the story has been great, and I've noticed an improvement in my text editing skills when working through Katas. 

I've always been a huge fan of 'learning by doing', and Vim Adventures takes this to the next level via gamification. Instead of working through page after page of trditional Vim exercises, and forcing my grey matter to memorize pages of commands, I'm traversing text mazes, and rescuing princesses.

If you're interested in learning Vim in a non-traditional way, head over to [Vim Adventures](https://www.vim-adventures.com), I'd also suggest taking a look at Lynda's excellent course in [Gamification for Interactive Learning](https://www.lynda.com/course-tutorials/Gamification-Interactive-Learning/573400-2.html).
