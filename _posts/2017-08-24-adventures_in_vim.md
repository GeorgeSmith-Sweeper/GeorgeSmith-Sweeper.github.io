I may have just found the most engaging way to learn Vim that has ever been created!

### Vim Adventures
Vim adventures is a Zelda like game that forces you to use Vims keyboard controls/commands in order to navigate your player and solve puzzles. 
So far the story has been great, and I've noticed an improvement in my text editing skills when working through Katas. 

I've always been a huge fan of 'learning by doing', and Vim Adventures takes this to the next level via gamification.
