Today I received my first code review at 8th Light! I had been waiting on this day since starting a python version of Tic-Tac-Toe back in August, and feverishly adding features to meet simulated client requests.  

For those unfamiliar with what a code review is, this wikipedia definition sums it up quite nicely:

>Code review is systematic examination (sometimes referred to as peer review) of computer source code. It is intended to find mistakes overlooked in software development, improving the overall quality of software.

Code reviews are such a large part of software development, that sites like [Code Review](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/) at stack exchange, exist for the sole purpose of giving feed back to programmers whoaren't working in a team setting.
