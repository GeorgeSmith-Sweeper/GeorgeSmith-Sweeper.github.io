### The problem

My apprenticeship at 8th Light requires that I write a significant amount of code to complete projects. I write most of the code for my projects in Vim in order to get a better understanding of it's features and quirks, and work towards mastering a mouse-less editor.

While my Vim setup is great for working in Python, I haven't taken the time to configure it for anything else, which makes working with Markdown a pain (the default jekyll blog format). I often reach for my mouse when making changes in before remembering that it's useless in Vim.

### Enter Sublime Text

In order to save time on the production of each post, I started using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to write my posts.

Out of the box, Sublime comes with a reasonable amount of syntax highlighting for Markdown, but with a single package [Markdown Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-markdown-extended) it can be greatly improved.

Here's what one of my previous posts looked like in Vim:

![Before]({{ GeorgeSmith-Sweeper.github.io }}/assets/vim_post.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Here's what the same post looks like in Sublime:

![After]({{ GeorgeSmith-Sweeper.github.io }}/assets/sublime_post.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Sublime has helped me identify active pieces of code in Markdown, and improved my understanding of the language.

### Summary

I'm in favor of using anything that speeds up my workflow.

Using Sublime for posts makes more sense to me (right now) because it's closer to being a word processor, and less like a command line system. The vibrant highlighting is icing on the cake, and if I'm really honest, I really missed my mouse...
