I am a software engineer based out of NYC, who enjoys solving puzzles, and taking complex problems and explaining them in a way that is easy for anyone to grasp.

When it comes to building projects, I'm language agnostic. I've created projects using, JavaScript, Python, and Java, and am currently learning Elixir.

I love learning and teaching, and will continue to grow as a developer by listening to the feedback from others and refining my talents. I use technology everyday, and it makes sense to become part of the driving force that moves things forward, by continuing to learn everyday.
